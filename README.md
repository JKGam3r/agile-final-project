OVERVIEW:
I will be playing the role of the product owner, scrum master, and developer.

  Product Owner: Create stories for the team and organize them for the product backlog

  Scrum Master: Create a sprint milestone and have stories that are ready for the sprint plan.

  Developer: Create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint.


BACKGROUND:
A group of stakeholders has approached my team asking us to develop the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website.  It is our job to introduce the functionality they are requesting, including the ability to create and delete products, along with implementing "Like" and "Dislike" buttons for the customers.  We will use ZehHub to make a kanban board and GitHub to make the designated repository.
